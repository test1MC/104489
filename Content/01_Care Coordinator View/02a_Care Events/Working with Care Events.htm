        <h1>Working with Care Events</h1>
        <p>What are Care Events?</p>
        <p>Care events are specific points of care along the care continuum, such as a procedure or operation.  Care events can have one or more Care Checklists related to them, pre or post event.</p>
        <p>There are several components to Care Events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patients can complete checklists prior to their Care Event. </li>
            <li>Coordinators can review outstanding items and work with patients to get them completed prior to the Care Event.</li>
            <li> Your organization can center activities around Care Events to better coordinate care. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A&#160;Care Event has a 1-1 relationship with a Patient. Patient A's knee replacement event is unique. Patient B's knee replacement event is unique as well. Care Events are not reused or copied, rather they can be thought of as containers for reusable information pertaining to that event.</p>
