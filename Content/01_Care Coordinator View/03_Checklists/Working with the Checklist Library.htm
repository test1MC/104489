        <h1>Working with the Checklist Library</h1>
        <p>Your organization can create a library of template Checklists for reuse. Over time, your library will consist of many Checklists that can be used repeatedly across different patient Care Events.</p>
        <p>Once you add a Checklist, it's added to your library permanently. For example, adding a templated Checklist, "Right Knee Replacement" can be created once and added to as many Care Events as needed.</p>
        <p>Think of Checklists as a patient's to-do list. You can assign those lists over and over, to different patients, having different procedures. Building a library of Checklists makes managing Care Events faster and easier for anyone coordinating patient care.</p>
