        <h1>Working with Care Steps</h1>
        <p>What is a Care Step?</p>
        <p>A care step is a single task for a patient to perform.  </p>
        <p>There are three types of steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Form</li>
            <li>Diagnostic</li>
            <li>Self-care<br /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Form Steps:&#160;</h3>
        <p>Form  Steps are associated with a form the patient is expected to complete. For example, a Form Step might be to "Sign a Consent Form". The structured data from the form will be captured and stored in Salesforce while an image of the completed form will be stored as a pdf in Salesforce.  </p>
        <h3>Diagnostic Steps:</h3>
        <p>A Diagnostic Step represents a test the patient must schedule and complete. For example: use a Diagnostic Step when the patient should schedule lab work and go to a lab to get it done. </p>
        <h3>Self-Care Steps:</h3>
        <p>A Self-Care Step represents a step the patient must complete on their own. Examples of Self-Care steps include: fasting, stopping medication and wound care.</p>
