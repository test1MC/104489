        <h1>Working with the Care Step Library</h1>
        <p>Your organization can build up a library of Care Steps for reuse. Over time, your library will consist of many Care Steps which can be used repeatedly across various patient Checklists.</p>
        <p>Once you add a Care Step, it's added to your library permanently. For example, adding the self-care Care Step, "Stop Fluids at Midnight" can be created once and added to multiple Checklists across as many Care Events as needed.</p>
        <p>Think of Care Steps as items on your patient's to-do list. You can assign those items over and over to different patients, having different procedures. Building up a library of Care Steps will make creating Checklists faster and easier for anyone coordinating patient care.</p>
